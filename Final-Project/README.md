# Parallel Algorithms In Kotlin 

Throughout DSA, majority of the algorithms are by nature, serial algorithms. My final project is to thus explore Fork-join parallel algorithms and see whether it's performance is better than it's serial counterparts. 


## Parallel Processing and in Kotlin (Coroutines)

In Kotlin, to achieve multi-threading, we use Coroutines, an official Kotlin library. In their own words, a coroutine is:

"A coroutine is an instance of a suspendable computation. It is conceptually similar to a thread, in the sense that it takes a block of code to run that works concurrently with the rest of the code. However, a coroutine is not bound to any particular thread. It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one."
