#Kotlin Refactoring Code & Tutorial

##By: Trinity Lee

##Tutorial
Kotlin initially seemed really interesting and seemed very well thought out. The tutorial have a good overview of the basics and I was intrigued by the interesting way of categorizing lists and maps. It became very clear that Kotlin vocabulary does not use the standard vocabulary in coding (instead of .size() it uses .count()) that I'm familiar with, so I guess I'll be getting used to the way it calls some of its functions. I'm pretty curious about how it'll be used for purposes of DSA, since usually DSA in my mind is associated with those Leetcode problems and Kotlin doesn't seem to be exactly the default language to use for those. One question I do have is whether Kotlin will have any transferable skills to other languag
es or whether Kotlin is just the chosen language for this course. I'm not really sure why we're using Kotlin, but I'm pretty excited!

##Refactoring
For this little exercise I just refactored my Markov word generator code in Python from Software Design into Kotlin with corresponding test cases, also taken from the Software Design
class. This was definitely a fun crash course into Kotlin and I learned a lot of the quirks of Kotlin. For example I found that it's very particular about the types of variables and l
ists, as well as the specific non-nullable subtypes. For example, there is a huge distinction between MutableMapOf and mapOf. Furthermore it was a slight struggle learning how to use
grable. I kept on getting a specific error but I think that I got the hang of it once I upgraded my grable version to 8.5. Overall, I'm not sure how to feel about this language as it
seems a lot more complicated than just the basic Java, though I'm not sure if the additional complexity is good...

Overall, my exercise worked A LOT with lists and maps, so I think in the terms for DSA, I'll be well prepared for handling the coding errors when it comes to them!
