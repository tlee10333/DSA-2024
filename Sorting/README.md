# Sorting Algorithm Implementations


I implemented 4 search algorithms:
 - Bubble Sort: From left to right, switch any values when larger. 
 - Selection Sort: from left to right, find smallest value and move it left
 - Merge Sort: Recursively, split list into 2, sort sublist, then put it back together
 - Quick Sort: Recursively, Find a pivot, everything on the left is smaller than pivot and everything on right is larger. Split left & sort again after choosing pivot. Same with right.

I also conducted benchmarking and researched AlphaDev, an AI system to optimize sorting on assembly level. The benchmarking and ALphaDev deep dive are in a pdf in this directory called `Benchmarking Functions.pdf`. The Master Theorem screenshots are in the `of subproblems.pdf`
