# Single Linked List Implementation (in Kotlin)

As part of DSA, this is an implementation of a single linked list. I used 2 classes, the Stack class and the StackNode class. The StackNode class carries data of the element in var `data` and points to the next stackNode in `next`. The Stack class has a single variable, `top` which tracks the "top" element since Single Linked Lists are LIFO. It also has 
various methods, such as `pop`, `peek`, `push`, and `isEmpty()` with corresponding documentation in the Main.kt file. 


There is also a test file in the `test` folder, which has a brief test of each method from the Stack class.
