# DAGs

Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs): A directed graph without any cycles (so you can't go back to any node through the vertices).

Kahn's algorithm: An algorithm which determines if a graph is cyclic or not. It solves it via topological sorting of our vertices

if edge E_i exists before E_j, then E_i must be smaller than E_j

Aka, all the edges must point to the right/one direction. 


1. Choose a node to start that has no incoming edges
2.
